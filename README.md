# Jobs Finding Application

This project is a job listing application built with Vue 3 and Vite. It allows users to browse job listings and view details about each job. The application fetches job data from a JSON server and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Browse job listings with loading and error states.
- View detailed job information.
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
- Easy navigation with Vue Router.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension (make sure to disable Vetur).

3. Start the JSON server to serve the job data:
